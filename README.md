=======

The code in this repo is stuff I write out of curiosity. I would not recommend taking any of this code as an example of my best work. I'll try to always post code that works, but most likely there's going to be some crazy man coding going on in this repo that you might not want to bear witness to. Viewers beware!

One of the uses for this repo, for me at least, is a repo where I can place proof of concept code. I have been using [gists] for interesting code patterns that I find or create, but I think I'll start posting to this repo a bit more often.
